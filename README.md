This project mainly deals on the following topics.

- Integration of Powermock and Mockito together along with Junit 5. 
- It also supports Junit 3 and Junit 4
- Mostly we may not need to have both the mocking framework in a same project
- **Powermock** can be used when **Mockito** does not support on mocking _static and private methods_, _constructor calls_
- **Mockito** offers a readable and very easy to use framework for mocking whereas **Powermock** enables us to perform complex mocking easily
